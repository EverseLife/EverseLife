 * The location and everything on it (D-089, D-106, D-116, D-150, D-204, D-205).
 *
 * The windows are cut by intent, not by where the code happened to grow, and
 * each stands on its own in the location's row (`Stand.tsx`):
 *
 * - **Участок** -- everything about the land itself: whose it is and what it is
 *   called, the door and the two lists (D-204), buying an empty plot, founding
 *   a city (D-159). Shut stops entry, never passage, so a neighbour is never
 *   cut off from their home;
 * - **Дом** -- build, then furnish: the walls and their demolition (D-205), and
 *   the machines and furniture that go into the house and take its slots
 *   (D-106, D-150). Working at somebody's machine is another matter: the
 *   machine has a row of its own;
 * - **На земле** -- storage, for everyone: the floor where whoever got in puts
 *   things down and picks them up (D-192, D-204), and the chests standing in
 *   the room (D-181). The door and the chest are the protection, not a rule;
 * - **Обоз** -- the wagon: harnessing, and the hold that carries what hands
 *   cannot (D-157);
 * - **Лес / Камни / Луг** -- extraction by the sign of the land (D-177), one
 *   row per sign, next to the other work of the place.
 *
 * Citizenship lives in the administration window (`Admin.tsx`): one joins a
 * city where the city makes its decisions (D-155, D-160). The former "Место"
 * window -- seven unrelated sections under one name -- is gone.
